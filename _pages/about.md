I am a computational hydrogeomorphologist and Vice-Chancellor Independent Research Fellow at Loughborough University, UK, and an Associate Member of the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford, UK. 

My research focuses on advancing process understanding of flood generation and improving quantitative estimates of flood extremes using big data and artificial intelligence.
I hold a PhD in Physical Geography from the University of Bristol, UK. 

Prior to my current role, I was a Research Associate on the NERC large grant EvoFlood project based at the University of Oxford (2022-2024) and then Loughborough University (2025), which investigated the evolution of global flood hazards and risks.
